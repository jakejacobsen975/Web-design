            <div id="aboutus">
            <p>Here you can chat with others about the hikes that you know about. 
                This page is here for three reasons. First, to create a community 
                of hikes in the area that like sharing the few hikes that few people 
                know about. The second is to ask questions from others so that they don’t 
                get lost, feel more prepared, or are just simply new to hiking and are in 
                need of tips. The third is to cover more hikes than what the website has. 
                Of course, there are way more hikes than one person can write about so Feel 
                free to ask others about hikes in a specific area.

            <h1><span>Comment Rules</span></h1>
            <div id="aboutus">
            <p>A few disclaimers are in order, please keep foul language out of your comments.
                 This website is supposed to be family-friendly so let’s keep it that way. 
                 Next please don’t suggest doing anything illegal or dangerous. 
                 Also if someone asks that you meet up with them please don’t, 
                 you never know what their true intentions are. Basically, just don’t 
                 be an idiot.

            <div id="aboutus">
            <p>Thank you for commenting really anything counts. If you do find an interesting 
                hike on this page make sure to thoroughly investigate what you are getting into. 
                Also, check the weather if you plan on walking through washes. There can be devastating 
                flash floods and lightning storms that although the sky may look blue can come in fast. </p></div>

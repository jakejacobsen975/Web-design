                <p>The Red Reef is about 3 miles to the point that is marked on the map. This is one way so the total amount round trip is about 6 miles. Gradient this trail keeps on going and connects to the red reef camping ground. If you feel like you are up for the 6 miles, then go for it. This hike would be labeled in the middle range of hiking difficulty. This is mostly because the trail is quite sandy which makes it harder because you sink back a little on every step. Coming back there is also a very small incline but it is not bad.

            <a href="https://earth.google.com/earth/d/1fNjirj_KDH_88cRFg630sWWx_-Yt8FmH?usp=sharing"><div id="redreefmap"></div></a>
            <h1><span>Water</span></h1>
            <div id="water"></div>
            <div id="aboutus"><p>
                Because this hike does take around 3 hours it is suggested that you take plenty of water. Depending on the season the amount of water needed will also change. 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Winter:</strong> bring about 16 to 32 fluid ounces (1-2 water bottles) of water.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Fall and spring:</strong> bring about 32 to 48 fluid ounces(2-3 water bottles) depending on how hot the weather is.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong> Summer:</strong> bring 48 or more fluid ounces(3 water bottles). It gets in the upper 100s in the summer so be very careful to bring plenty of water and to take frequent breaks to avoid heatstroke.
                        This hike is a little bit nicer to hike in because it is a wash/ canyon. The walls around you act like a tunnel so there is more wind to cool you off which decreases the amount of water needed. Although, still make sure to bring at least these recommended amounts.
                        </li></ul>
                This may seem like a lot but your body needs more water when you are hiking in hotter temperatures, especially because St George is a desert after all.
                </ul></p></div>

            <div id="jacket"></div>
                <div id="aboutus">
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Winter:</strong>  bring a jacket and maybe another light jacket just in case the wind picks up
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Fall and spring:</strong> light jacket preferably with a hood to keep out sun and wind. Also might as well wear some sunscreen.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong> Summer:</strong> definitely wear sunscreen you will get burned if you don't. You may also want to look into a buff. They will keep the sun and sand out of your face.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            <h1><span>What to Watch Out For</span></h1>
            <div id="warning"></div>
            <div id="aboutus">
                <p>Look out for rattlesnakes everywhere around here. I have had a few close calls myself and trust me you don't want to surprise one.<br><br>
                    On this trail lookout on stormy days and windy days. If there is rain do not attempt to do this hike. Although it may look nice where you are at if there is a flash flood water will fill up the wash and take anything standing there with it. Windy weather can also be dangerous because as stated before canyons act like a funnel for the wind.
